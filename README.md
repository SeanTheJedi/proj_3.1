# ðŸ“š Simple Library Web App

A lightweight library management web application built with **Vanilla JavaScript**, **Standard CSS**, and **Semantic HTML**.  
It allows users to:

- Log in with their **library card number** and **password** (from a pre-generated list of users)
- View all available books
- Borrow books
- Return borrowed books
- See borrowed books and personal profile details
- Book availability is updated **globally** for all users
- State is persisted using **localStorage** so data remains after refreshing
